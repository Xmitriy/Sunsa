# autoexplore
A mod that ports the autoexplore feature from Dungeon Crawl: Stone Soup.

## Usage
Press <kbd>E</kbd> to start autoexplore in the current map. It will end automatically if the player is damaged or an enemy is sighted.

Press <kbd>T</kbd> to select and travel to a known location in the map.

## TODO
- Support traps/map effects.
- Allow configuring when to stop if enemies are sighted.
- Allow confirmation of the path about to be traveled.
- Improve status message when all of the reachable map has been explored (not counting unexplored areas blocked off by walls).
